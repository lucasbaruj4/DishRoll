# Changelog

## 2026-02-13
- Set auth `TextInput` keyboard appearance to dark on `Sign Up` and `Log In` so iOS keyboard theme matches the dark UI.
- Added explicit header-left chevron buttons on `Log In` and `Sign Up` that route back to onboarding, ensuring a visible iOS-style back control even when no prior stack entry exists.
- Ensured auth-screen back affordance stays label-less while preserving iOS chevron styling.
- Updated `Log In` header back button to chevron-only (no label) and removed the in-screen `Back to intro` link.
- Switched auth cross-links between `Log In` and `Sign Up` to `replace` navigation and enabled `animationTypeForReplace: 'pop'` on both screens for consistent stack-direction transitions.
- Updated signup header back button to chevron-only (`headerBackButtonDisplayMode: 'minimal'`) so the `Onboarding` label is not shown.
- Implemented `Saved` tab data integration with Supabase `recipes` (`is_saved = true`): saved recipes now load on focus/reload, support pull-to-refresh, and can be deleted from the app.
- Added per-user local persistence for last-used Generate macro/time targets so app reload restores the most recent quick-generation inputs without introducing a global default.
- Added per-user local active-deck resume state (recipe IDs, swipe index, ingredient signature) and DB-backed hydration on app load so persisted decks continue where users left off after reload.
- Added recipe lookup helper (`getRecipesByIds`) for ordered deck restoration from Supabase based on locally persisted deck IDs.
- Refactored `Generate` tab into a persistent swipe-deck-first experience with macro editing in a non-blocking bottom sheet instead of a page-level control stack.
- Added ingredient-sync awareness for generated decks (`Not synced recipes`) so users can keep swiping older decks while seeing when inventory has drifted.
- Improved swipe-deck card presentation with stronger visual hierarchy (hero area, progress indicator, macro chips) while preserving existing save/skip behavior.
- Reworked macro editing ergonomics: replaced +/- stepping with direct numeric entry, deferred clamping/normalization until blur/Done/Generate, and added iOS keyboard accessory `Done`.
- Fixed macro sheet keyboard UX across device sizes by using keyboard frame-driven dynamic insets so footer/actions avoid keyboard overlap on iOS and Android.
- Simplified Generate interaction model to remove duplicate execution actions: macro sheet is now editor-only with `Done`, and deck generation/regeneration/sync is triggered by a single main-screen CTA.
- Removed explicit `Skip`/`Save` action buttons from Generate to align with swipe-first interaction; swiping is now the only accept/reject action.
- Added a one-time swipe tutorial overlay (animated left/right hint + required "I understand swipe controls" checkbox + `Got it`) persisted locally so it only appears until acknowledged.

## 2026-02-12
- Hardened edge generation request handling with ingredient input length caps and OpenAI upstream timeout protection (`openai_timeout` -> HTTP 504).
- Replaced SDK edge invoke path for recipe generation with explicit HTTPS call to `https://<project-ref>.functions.supabase.co/generate-recipes` using bearer session token + `apikey` to avoid persistent `invalid JWT` gateway ambiguity.
- Updated function auth propagation to use `supabase.functions.setAuth(accessToken)` before invoke, preventing publishable-key authorization from being treated as JWT by edge gateway.
- Added automatic auth-session refresh + single retry for recipe generation when edge function returns `invalid JWT`.
- Fixed recipe-generation edge invoke auth propagation by explicitly attaching the current Supabase access token to function requests.
- Fixed Inventory ingredient tile layout regression (names rendering vertically due nested width constraints) by removing extra wrapper sizing.
- Changed Inventory availability edits to staged changes with an animated floating bottom action bar and explicit `Save changes` commit button.
- Made Edge Function model configurable via server secret: `OPENAI_MODEL` (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`) so testing can switch to cheaper models without code changes.
- Expanded `docs/OPENAI_EDGE_FUNCTION_SETUP.md` with explicit OpenAI setup details: model used, prompt used, and fast/low-cost dev testing guidance.
- Hardened `generate-recipes` Edge Function with authenticated-user enforcement, per-user rolling rate limiting (12 requests / 15 minutes), and request usage logging.
- Added migration `supabase/migrations/0007_2026_02_12_recipe_generation_logs.sql` for `recipe_generation_logs` (indexes + RLS policy) used by rate limiting and observability.
- Updated `docs/OPENAI_EDGE_FUNCTION_SETUP.md` with migration step (`supabase db push`) plus secure deploy flow.
- Moved OpenAI recipe generation off the client into Supabase Edge Function `generate-recipes` (`supabase/functions/generate-recipes/index.ts`) so API keys are server-only.
- Switched app generation calls to `supabase.functions.invoke('generate-recipes')` with local-draft fallback if the function is unavailable.
- Removed `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` from client env templates (`.env.local`, `.env.example`) and documented secure setup in `docs/OPENAI_EDGE_FUNCTION_SETUP.md`.
- Added recipe generation infrastructure with robust local fallback behavior for both generation and persistence failures.
- Removed the `Quick Generate` top panel from `Generate` while keeping the four macro/prep cards and `Generate Swipe Deck` action as requested.
- Reordered bottom tabs to the requested sequence: `Generate`, `Inventory`, `Saved`, `Profile`.
- Set `Generate` as the default tab landing route (tab layout, root index redirect, and post-auth/post-questionnaire redirects).
- Revamped the `Generate` screen visual design with card-based hierarchy and improved macro input layout.
- Migrated generate ingredient sourcing from legacy `ingredients` table to onboarding-backed `user_ingredients` + `ingredient_catalog`.
- Rebuilt `Inventory` UI to match onboarding ingredient selection: searchable quick-pick tiles with identical tile component and styling direction.
- Added `useUserIngredients` hook for availability state management on `user_ingredients`.
- Updated dev RLS checks to validate `user_ingredients` instead of deprecated `ingredients`.
- Applied visual polish to `Saved` and `Profile` tab screens for consistent styling.

## 2026-02-11
- Continuing frontend refinement on onboarding and auth-related UX details.
- Backend feature work is queued next after onboarding polish is finalized.
- Fixed onboarding carousel card clipping and edge overflow behavior.
- Added animated onboarding background circles and scroll-linked pagination dots.
- Tuned card spacing and indicator sizing for cleaner slide transitions.
- Started planning the post-signup `initial_questionaire` flow for new users.
- Defined three-step questionnaire scope: available ingredients, allergies/disliked foods, and cooking level.
- Beginning implementation with the first questionnaire screen focused on ingredient selection UI.
- Added `initial_questionaire` route pipeline and wired signup redirect to the ingredient step.
- Implemented ingredient questionnaire UI with searchable quick-pick tiles backed by `ingredient_catalog`.
- Added persistence from ingredient questionnaire selections into `user_ingredients`.
- Added profile-based questionnaire gating so logged-in users are redirected to onboarding until setup is complete.
- Added dietary restriction source-of-truth schema: `dietary_restriction_catalog` + `user_dietary_restrictions` with RLS and seed options.
- Added fully implemented allergies/dislikes questionnaire step with searchable catalog UI and persistence to `user_dietary_restrictions`.
- Refactored questionnaire persistence into shared service utilities and renamed step state from `level` to `cooking_level` for clarity.
- Added normalized `cooking_level_catalog` (5-point scale) and implemented step 3 with a fixed-stop slider UI that saves selected level to user profile.
- Fixed onboarding resume routing so incomplete users return to their saved questionnaire step instead of always restarting at ingredients.
- Polished cooking-level slider interaction by locking page scroll during drag and fixing knob edge alignment at both track extremes.
- Added explicit Back buttons to all `initial_questionaire` steps (ingredients, allergies/dislikes, cooking level).
- Synced questionnaire progress state when navigating backward so resume returns to the correct previous step.
- Confirmed multi-select questionnaire persistence uses delete-then-insert on every Continue for both `user_ingredients` (questionnaire source) and `user_dietary_restrictions`.
- Tightened ingredient prefill in the questionnaire to only read rows with `source = 'questionnaire'`.
- Replaced in-screen Back buttons with iOS-style header back controls for all questionnaire steps.
- Fixed unreliable back navigation by routing header back actions directly to deterministic previous-step routes.
- Adjusted questionnaire navigation to use deterministic `router.replace(...)` transitions for both forward and backward step moves.
- Removed back-step profile rewrites that could incorrectly downgrade resume position from `cooking_level` to earlier steps.
- Hid header back controls while a save request is in progress to prevent duplicate navigation actions.
- Fixed root auth gate regression that forced users back to the persisted questionnaire step, which blocked intentional in-flow back navigation.
- Updated questionnaire step navigation to use stack semantics (`push` forward, `back` backward) for native linear transition direction.
- Added one-time initial questionnaire route sync on app bootstrap so reopen respects the persisted DB step without overriding in-flow back navigation.
- Tightened auth gating for incomplete users so only `initial_questionaire/*` routes are allowed, preventing onboarding/login detours from breaking questionnaire back-stack expectations.
- Updated questionnaire back flow to deterministic linear behavior: step 3 -> step 2 -> step 1 -> onboarding (no loop back to step 3).
- Adjusted incomplete-user auth gating to allow staying on onboarding and only resume questionnaire when re-entering, using persisted DB step sync.
- Updated onboarding CTA behavior for signed-in incomplete users to show `Resume setup` and route into questionnaire resume path.
- Hid onboarding header (`Welcome`) to remove redundant back navigation from the intro screen.
- Switched questionnaire back handlers to `dismissTo(...)` and configured `animationTypeForReplace: 'pop'` for questionnaire + onboarding routes to keep back-like iOS transitions on replace fallbacks.
- Disabled iOS swipe-back gestures on questionnaire screens so navigation advances/returns only through explicit controls.
- Fixed post-setup routing race in root auth gate by refreshing questionnaire progress on route changes and immediately redirecting completed users to `/(tabs)/inventory`.
- Applied dark-mode styling to tab navigator chrome: dark header and dark bottom tab bar with updated active/inactive tint colors.
- Removed the `Onboarding` text label from the signup screen back button so only the back chevron is shown.
- Updated sign-out behavior to clear local auth session state/storage immediately, preventing stale-session limbo after server-side user deletion.
